Image carousel with Elementor using different size/ratio pictures fix

If you have different ratio pictures and create a carousel with Elementor, elementor will not make them all the same size.

I created a small CSS snippet to fix this. 
My code have media queries at the breackpoints the carousel changes number of pictures shown, so that immage will be always the same size, no matter the viewport.

Just play with height value to ajust the carousel to your need/taste.
